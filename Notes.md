Glass Interaction:
    1. Treat glass as a rectangle (or polygon) with a refractive index n > 1.
    2. When a ray hits a glass edge:
        * Apply Snell’s Law to compute the new direction
            n1sinbeta1 = n2sinbeta2
        * n1 = refractive index of medium before the glass (1.0 for air)
        * n2 = refractive index of glass (e.g., 1.5)
    3. Inside the glass, the ray travels straight until it hits another edge; then it exits, bending back to air.
