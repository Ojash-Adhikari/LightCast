Overview

LightCast is an advanced developer toolkit designed for creating interactive optical simulations and visualizations.
It enables precise modeling of light behavior, including refraction, reflection, and transparent material interactions in dynamic scenes.

Why LightCast?

This project empowers developers and educators to create realistic optical visualizations using:

✨ Features

🔬 Scientific Accuracy
Implements Snell’s Law, ray tracing, and accurate angle calculations for realistic light refraction and reflection.

🎨 Interactive Control
Real-time scene manipulation through user input, enabling dynamic adjustments and experimentation.

🚀 Modular Architecture
Core components such as MoveBox, LightSource, and Glass allow flexible extension and customization.

💡 High Visual Fidelity
Accurate rendering of transparent materials and complex light paths.

⚙️ Developer-Friendly
Easy integration with custom graphics engines, simulation tools, and educational applications.
